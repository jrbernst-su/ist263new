    Hello, my name is Jesse Bernstein. I am an Information Management and Technology major and I hope to take it into the retail world. Throughout my life, I have been involved in various outdoor retail establishments. For example, I worked at a ski and bike shop for a few years. Outside of school, you can usually find me outdoors. Whether it be skiing, mountain biking, fishing, or hunting, I love to be outside.
